# TURTL
## Introduction
TURTL is an acronym for VirTUal NetwoRk SecuriTy Lab. TURTL is an innovative, virtual and expandable learning environment for IT security in computer networks. TURTL started as a ["Fellowship für Innovationen in der digitalen 
Hochschullehre" (Digi-Fellow)](https://www.dh.nrw/kooperationen/Digi-Fellows-2) project funded by the "Ministerium für Kultur und Wissenschaft NRW". TURTL was initiated by Prof. Dr. Gundula Dörries (deceased) and [Prof. Dr. Holger Schmidt](https://www.fh-dortmund.de/personen/Holger-Schmidt1/index.php).

### Core Purpose
The primary goal of TURTL is to provide a hands-on experience in IT security in computer networks, bridging the gap between academic theory and practical application. TURTL intends to support flexible and active learning, independently of location and without major preparation and supervision effort. Virtualization enables the provision of typical infrastructures, thereby making complex hardware and theory-heavy simulations unnecessary. 

### Unique Features
- **Role-Based Scenarios:** TURTL offers distinct roles for students to engage with, including Attack, Defense, and Neutral. Each role presents unique challenges and learning opportunities.
- **Practical Tasks:** Students work on tasks within a terminal environment (which is based on virtualization).
- **Interactive Learning:** TURTL encourages active learning, where students can test and refine their skills in a dynamic and responsive environment.

### Educational Benefits
TURTL aims to:
- Improve the practical understanding of IT security concepts.
- Allow students to experience and respond to IT security challenges relevant in practice.
- Reduce the effort to provide practical scenarios using virtualization.
